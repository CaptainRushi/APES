# APES Project State

## Current Plan

- Phase: 06
- Plan: 01
- Status: completed

## Progress

- Total Plans: 6
- Completed: 5
- Remaining: 1

## Last Session

- Timestamp: 2026-02-23
- Stopped At: Completed 06-01 — APES v2 Architecture Foundation Build

## Decisions

- Terminal visualization using ANSI escape sequences
- Event-driven animation (not polling)
- 30 FPS frame capping for CPU efficiency
- [Phase 03]: Two-column render model for TODO panel
- [Phase 04]: Mandatory interactive gating for all filesystem mutations
- [Phase 05]: Cleaned up temporary and unused files
- [Phase 06]: APES v2 complete rewrite — zero-dependency architecture
  - 10-stage cognitive pipeline
  - DAG-based scheduling with topological wave execution
  - 6 agent clusters with 11 pre-registered agents
  - 4-layer memory system
  - Reinforcement scoring learning system
  - Interactive permission handler with audit logging
  - Worker pool with bounded concurrency (simulation mode)
